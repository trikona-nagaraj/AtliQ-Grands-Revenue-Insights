Problem statement
------------------------------------

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. Due to ineffective decision-making Atliq Grands are losing their market share and revenue this Report enables the stakeholders to understand present business and incorporate relative strategies to improve their Revenue & Market Share. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

As part of the codebasics september month resume challenge, I have worked on this analysis project.
